/*

 This partially finished application is for a Tic-Tac-Toe
 game.

 The game uses a Ttt_Game_Board_class class that manages the board spots in an array property.
 - Uses a property to track if the game is active or has ended
 - Uses a property to keep up with the number of turns taken

 The game provides methods to Draw the board
 - Place an X or O in a specified space (0 - 8 in the board space array)
 - Checks if there has been a winner
 - Checks if their has been a tie (CAT)
